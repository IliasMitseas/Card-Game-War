# Card-Game-War
This is a simulation of the card game called War. There are plenty versions of the game but in that specific edition I simulate the classic version of the game. 
The game is played by the computer. 
We will use Python OOP to simulate a simplified version of the game war. Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which 
card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards. The game continues until one player wins all cards or one player has not enough cards
to start a war.
